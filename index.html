  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Having recently completed an immersive front-end class at <a href="https://www.theironyard.com/">The Iron Yard</a> in Atlanta, I am now a freelance web developer working primarily with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.  The experience of developing a project from the faintest glimmer of an idea to something on a page that serves a function is a tremendous thrill!

  Please take a look at some of my projects.  I enjoy working on individual 'pet' projects such as the family picture album.  Even more, I enjoy the team environment where I can collaborate with others and contribute by solving problems and moving ideas toward something tangible.
  </p>
  <p>Below are a few of my favorite projects ... but there are a lot more.  Feel free to look around at <a href = "https://github.com/taheaton"><span>https://github.com/taheaton</span></a><br><br>

<div class = "sidekick">
  <div class="sidekickText">
    <a href="http://curious-invention.surge.sh/#/signup"><h2>Movie Sidekick</h2></a>
    <a href="http://curious-invention.surge.sh/#/signup">Link</a>
    <p>Movie Sidekick was an idea of mine that essentially was to take the "Goodreads" concept to the world of movies.</p>
    <p>The app allows the user to search movies, review movies, connect with other users, and even watch movies on amazon or purchase tickets to current films.</p>
    <p>We used a number of Angular tools, services, controllers and directives on this fairly complex app.</p>

  <div class="godfatherText">
    <a href="http://nostalgic-nerve.surge.sh/#/"><h2>Godfather Instagram</h2></a>
        <a href="http://nostalgic-nerve.surge.sh/#/">Link</a>

    <p>We did a number of 'instagram' type projects which allows the user to view pictures or people in different levels of detail as well as add data to the website.</p>
    <p>The Godfather app was fun for me as it allowed me to create my own spin on the assignment.  I had a lot of fun picking movie quotes and characters to include as well as some fun 'gangster' links.</p>
    <p>I used a number of Angular tools on this app and parse.com as my data host.</p>

  <div class="albumText">
    <a href="http://heavenly-stamp.surge.sh/#picture"><h2>Family Album</h2></a>
        <a href="http://heavenly-stamp.surge.sh/#picture">Link</a>

    <p>This is a very personal app that includes fun pictures from my family.</p>
    <p>I used react and a number of cool formatting tools including bourbon and neat to align columns and provide for picture formatting.  I also used parse for data storage.</p>

  <div class="consultingText">
    <a href="http://future-pie.surge.sh/#/"><h2>Consulting Company</h2></a>
    <a href="http://future-pie.surge.sh/#/">Link</a>

    <p>A friend of mine has a consulting company and asked me to produce a website that allowed for basic content as well as a vehicle to contact directly.</p>
    <p>I spent a lot of time making this app look 'finished'.  I like the professional appearance and how easy it is to change the appearance by simply changing accent colors or the background image.</p>
    <p>I used angular and the angular router for JavaScript delivery.</p>
